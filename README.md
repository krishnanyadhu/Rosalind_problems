# Rosalind Problems 🧬

This repository contains my solutions to various **[Rosalind](http://rosalind.info/problems/list-view/)** bioinformatics problems.  
Each problem is solved using Python and Jupyter notebooks.

📌 Note

⚠️ I am still working on this repository. These are my initial solutions to Rosalind problems, and the repo will be updated as I progress further.
